      <h2>Past</h2>
      <p>
        While I don't have a professional background in tech yet, my curiosity
        and self-driven learning journey began here. I started exploring how
        computers communicate, and it sparked a deeper passion for networking.

      <h2>Present</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently studying Computer Science and dedicating my time to
        learning networking protocols, Cisco fundamentals, and configuring
        routers and switches via simulation tools like Cisco Packet Tracer.

      <h2>Future</h2>
      <p>
        I aim to become a certified network engineer, contribute to building
        secure and scalable infrastructures, and work with global tech teams.
        My goal is to bridge connections â€“ literally and metaphorically.
